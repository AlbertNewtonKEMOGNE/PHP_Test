# PHP_Test
This is a small testing project,
It is composed of five files, respectively :
- cars.json which contains multiple cars infomations in JSON format,
- index.html, which shows all the informations on cars in a HTML table,
- script.js, used to sort cars by their colors,
- script.php, to sort cars by their prices
- and style.css to style the HTML contents.
